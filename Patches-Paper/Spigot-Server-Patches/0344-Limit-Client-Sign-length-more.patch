Subject: [PATCH] Limit Client Sign length more

modified clients can send more data from the client
to the server and it would get stored on the sign as sent.

Mojang has a limit of 384 which is much higher than reasonable.

the client can barely render around 16 characters as-is, but formatting
codes can get it to be more than 16 actual length.

Set a limit of 80 which should give an average of 16 characters 2
sets of legacy formatting codes which should be plenty for all uses.

This does not strip any existing data from the NBT as plugins
may use this for storing data out of the rendered area.

it only impacts data sent from the client.

Set -DPaper.maxSignLength=XX to change limit or -1 to disable
