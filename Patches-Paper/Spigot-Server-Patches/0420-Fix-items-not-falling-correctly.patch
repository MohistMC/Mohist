Subject: [PATCH] Fix items not falling correctly

Since 1.14, Mojang has added an optimization which skips checking if
an item should fall every fourth tick.

However, Spigot's entity activation range class also has an
optimization which skips ticking active entities every fourth tick.
This can result in a state where an item will never properly fall
due to its move method never being called.

This patch resolves the conflict by offsetting checking an item's
move method from Spigot's entity activation range check.
