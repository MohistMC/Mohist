 * WARNING: This event only fires for a limited number of cases, and not for every case that CreatureSpawnEvent does.

 * You should still listen to CreatureSpawnEvent as a backup, and only use this event as an "enhancement".
 * The intent of this event is to improve server performance, so limited use cases.

 * Currently: NATURAL and SPAWNER based reasons. Please submit a Pull Request for future additions.
 * Also, Plugins that replace Entity Registrations with their own custom entities might not fire this event.
