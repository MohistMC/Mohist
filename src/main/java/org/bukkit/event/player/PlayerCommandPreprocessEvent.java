/**
 * This event is called whenever a player runs a command (by placing a slash
 * at the start of their message). It is called early in the command handling
 * process, and modifications in this event (via {@link #setMessage(String)})
 * will be shown in the behavior.
 * <p>
 * Many plugins will have <b>no use for this event</b>, and you should
 * attempt to avoid using it if it is not necessary.
 * <p>
 * Some examples of valid uses for this event are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Logging executed commands to a separate file
 * <li>Variable substitution. For example, replacing
 *     <code>${nearbyPlayer}</code> with the name of the nearest other
 *     player, or simulating the <code>@a</code> and <code>@p</code>
 *     decorators used by Command Blocks in plugins that do not handle it.
 * <li>Conditionally blocking commands belonging to other plugins. For
 *     example, blocking the use of the <code>/home</code> command in a
 *     combat arena.
 * <li>Per-sender command aliases. For example, after a player runs the
 *     command <code>/calias cr gamemode creative</code>, the next time they
 *     run <code>/cr</code>, it gets replaced into
 *     <code>/gamemode creative</code>. (Global command aliases should be
 *     done by registering the alias.)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Examples of incorrect uses are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Using this event to run command logic
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the event is cancelled, processing of the command will halt.
 * <p>
 * The state of whether or not there is a slash (<code>/</code>) at the
 * beginning of the message should be preserved. If a slash is added or
 * removed, unexpected behavior may result.
